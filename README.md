# Linux Message Queues Repository

Welcome to the Linux Message Queues Repository! This collection of C programs serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding and working with message queues in the Linux operating system.

## What are Message Queues in Linux?

Message queues are a powerful inter-process communication mechanism in Linux, allowing processes to exchange data efficiently. The `msgget()` system call is used to create new message queues or retrieve the ID of an existing queue. The key features include:

- **Key Generation:** The `key_t` parameter, generated using the `IPC_PRIVATE` constant or `ftok()`, serves as a unique identifier for the message queue.

- **Permission Bits:** The `msgflag` parameter specifies permission bits, including options like `IPC_CREAT` for creating a new queue and `IPC_EXCL` for ensuring exclusive creation.

- **Dynamic Communication:** Message queues facilitate communication between processes, providing a structured way to send and receive messages.

## Repository Highlights:

Explore a variety of C programs within this repository, each designed to showcase different aspects of message queue manipulation and functionality. The programs include demonstrations of message creation, manipulation, and deletion.
